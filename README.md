## Requirements
A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory. Your code should be W3C compliant and validate with the W3C-Validator. The name "Techium" will be used as the company name across our webpages. Sitemap of the Project Please refer to the sitemap below to understand the structure of the project:
```
- index.html

  - style.css
- images/
  - logo.png
- videos/
  - demo.mp4

In this project, we will create multiple HTML pages, such as index.html, about.html, services.html, products.html, and contact.html. Additionally, we will have a CSS folder for the style.css file, an images folder for the logo.png image, a videos folder for the demo.mp4 video, an audio folder for the background.mp3 audio file, and an external folder for the external-content.html external content file.

Feel free to organize your project structure according to your preference, but ensure that the HTML files are named as mentioned above and that the corresponding CSS, images, videos, audio, and external content files are placed in the appropriate folders.

Remember to apply the concepts learned throughout the project to create a well-structured and visually appealing website for the fictional company "Techium."
